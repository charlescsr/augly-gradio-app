Overlaying emojis on an image using Augly.

This Gradio app lets you upload an image and overlay an emoji on top of it.

The settings that can be tweaked:

* Emoji Size - How big the emoji should look
* Opacity - A higher value means you can see the emoji more clearly
* X and Y coordinates - These determine where the emoji is overlaid in the image
